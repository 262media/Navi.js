Navi.js - Content Switcher
=======

Navi.js makes it easy to dynamically display content on your sites. Instead of cluttering up your site tree with extra files, you can easily write all of your html code for multiple pages in one file.

Navi leverages <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/">Ben Alman's hashchange plugin</a> to change content based on the current hash. This allows the use of the back button functionality.

Navi is also friendly with other plugins, and can be called on multiple objects or nested together.
